""" Demonstrations

***geonodes*** comes with a set of demo files.

## Tutorials

### Hello World

<!helloworld> : a simple demo to start

### Arrows

<!arrows> : create an arrow with cartesian, polar or spherical coordinates. Or a field of arrows.

### Curly

<!curly> : playing with curves topology

### Explosition

<!explosion> : a sphere explodes and pieces are projected and fall with gravity

### Forest

<!forest> : generating a simple forest

### Gravity

<!gravity>: Newton law simulated on a bunch of planets

### Rain

<!rain>: simulation of dips falling on a terrain with puddles. Dips on the puddles generate waves,
when dips on the terrain produce projections.

### Topology

<!topology>: after a discussion  with @pterusgithub, here are modifier to explore domain indices


## Utilities

Some modifiers can be used in production

### Counters

<!counters> to build digital or analogic counters, including a digital clock.

### Fields

<!fields> comes with modifiers to compute and visualize electromagnetic fields. The base
components I used in my videos on electromagnetism.


### 4D Engine

<!fourd> the 4D engine I used in my videos on 4D

### Fractal

<!fractal>: to play with fractals but not only. Also comes with a comprhensive camera culling
a gaussian random generator and a multires surface modifier.
